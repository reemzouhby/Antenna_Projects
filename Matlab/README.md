# MATLAB

This folder contains MATLAB scripts for two projects:

1. **Project 1 – Dipole Antenna Radiation Patterns**

   * Simulates Hertzian and finite-length dipole radiation patterns.
   * Generates 2D polar plots, 3D radiation patterns, and calculates directivity.

2. **Project 2 – Antenna Arrays (Broadside & End-Fire)**

   * Broadside arrays: Varies number of elements (N) and element spacing (d/λ).
   * End-fire arrays: Varies number of elements (N) with fixed spacing (d/λ = 0.25).
   * Generates 2D and 3D radiation patterns for each configuration.
